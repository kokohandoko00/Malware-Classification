# Malware Classification using XGBoost and SVM

The goal of this project is to classify the level of malware based on provided dataset. 

## Dataset
The dataset consists of train and test data. There are 2 columns and 2500 observations in train data. Which the first column is an index and the second column is the level of malware. Besides, there are 1667 observations in test data and only contains 1 column index in test data. We will predict the level of malware using test data

## XGBoost and SVM
I use two machine learning models, the SVM algorithm and XGBoost. This is done because we want to compare the accuracy of the two models and choose the best one. SVM is a supervised learning method used for classification, regression, and outlier detection. This model can solve linear and non-linear problems. The basic idea of this algorithm is to create a line or hyperplane that separates data into classes. Meanwhile, XGBoost is an ensemble method of Machine Learning algorithm based on decision tree that uses a gradient boosting framework. Ensemble method is a machine learning concept in which there are many predictors. This results in an increased level of accuracy compared to using a method that only has a single predictor.
